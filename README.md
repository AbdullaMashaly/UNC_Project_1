Project-1 - Impact of Insurance and Income on Heart Disease Mortality
Team Members: Abdulla Mashaly, Elijah Reid, Hannah Doby, and Rebecca Balderas

Project Description:
For this project, we researched the impact of insurance and income on heart disease mortality. We conducted the research through the use of data compiled through the Census Bureau and Centers for Disease Control. 
We focused our research on the state of North Carolina. We pulled income level in relation to the poverty line by county from the census bureau. We also pulled data from a study conducted by the US goverment regarding
heart mortality by county. 

Research Questions to Answer:

1. If an individual has insurance, are they less likely to die from heart disease?
2. If an individual is below the poverty line, are they more likely to die from heart disease?
3. Is there a significant impact to an individual's ability to survive heart disease due to their income and insurance coverage?
