Project 1: Proposal

Project Title: 
    Impact of health insurance and prevalence of heart attacks

Team Members: 
    Rebecca Balderas, Elijah Reid, Abdulla Mashaly, and Hannah Doby

Project Description:
    We will investigate the connection between participants’ health insurance by North Carolina county and prevalence of heart disease mortality in North Carolina.  

Research questions to Answer:
    We hope to study the impact of health insurance use and heart disease mortality. We will explore if there is a pattern to having health insurance and cross reference it to heart disease mortality. Our hypothesis is that the availability of health insurance to consumers, the less likely there will be heart disease mortality. 

Datasets to be used:
    Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) [State and County 2006-2020].
    Heart Disease Mortality by County API

Rough breakdown of Tasks:
    Rebecca – Code for Health Insurance and Heart Disease, Powerpoint creation
    Elijah – Code for Health Insurance and Heart Disease,  Powerpoint creation
    Abdulla – Code for Health Insurance and Heart Disease,  Powerpoint creation
    Hannah – Code for Health Insurance and Heart Disease,  Powerpoint creation
